## Averages & Central Tendency
These functions go in `round.rs` and handle averages and such.

- [X] Implement `mean()` (arithmetic average)
- [X] Implement `median()`
- [X] Implement `mode()` (most frequent value)
- [X] Implement `round_nearest()` (round to nearest integer)
- [X] Implement `round_decimal_places()` (round to specific decimal places)

## Measures of Spread / Deviation
These functions go in `deviate.rs` and deal mostly with deviations of data, etc.

- [ ] Implement `range()` (max - min)
- [ ] Implement `variance()`
- [ ] Implement `std_dev()` (standard deviation)
- [ ] Implement `mad()` (median absolute deviation)

## Sorting & Ordering
These functions go in `sort.rs` and sort the data and order it neatly.

- [X] Implement `sort()` (sort in numerical order)

## Summations & Counts
These functions go in `enumerate.rs` and enumerate [sort and count] the data.

- [X] Implement `sum()` (sum of all values)
- [X] Implement `count()` (number of values)
